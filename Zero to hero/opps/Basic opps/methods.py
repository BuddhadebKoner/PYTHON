'''
In a class, all functions are called methods.

# NORMAL METHODS --->

class Methods:
    def __init__(self, value):  # class constructor method
        print("In class Methods...")
        self.value = value
        print("The value is:", self.value)

    def welcome(self):  # this is object-level method, that's why it has a self parameter
        print('Welcome here')

Create a Student class that takes name & marks of 3 subjects as arguments in the constructor, then create a method to print the average.

# STATIC METHODS -->

'''
Methods Are dont use self parameter(work at class lavel not obj lavel)
